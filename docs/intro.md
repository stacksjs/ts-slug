## Why Use Slugs?

Slugs are URL-friendly versions of text strings, commonly used for:

- **SEO-friendly URLs**: Improve search engine visibility with descriptive URLs
- **Readability**: Make your URLs human-readable and memorable
- **Compatibility**: Avoid special characters that might cause issues in URLs
- **Consistency**: Ensure uniform URL patterns across your application

## Quick Example

```ts
import slug from 'ts-slug'

// Basic usage
slug('Hello World') // 'hello-world'

// With options
slug('Hello World', {
  replacement: '_',
  lower: false
}) // 'Hello_World'

// Multilingual support
slug('„Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ‰∏ñÁïå') // 'konnichihasei-jie'
slug('Sch√∂ne Gr√º√üe', { locale: 'de' }) // 'schoene-gruesse'
```
